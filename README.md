This repository is the entirety of code and data for the article "Contrasting Resistance and Resilience Trajectories of Zooplankton Communities in Restored Fishless Alpine Lake Ecosystems".

This is available as open research is important for transparancy and progression of our fields.

Please note: This project was my first time working in R and is, unfortunately, messy but as simplistic as possible.
Please reach out to me if you have questions about the data or code at bstupary@ualberta.ca .
